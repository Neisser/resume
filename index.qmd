## Resume

### 👨‍💻 Summary

I'm a backend engineer with a front-end superpower (React & Next.js, to be specific ). I code fluently in JavaScript & Node.js, and dabble in Go, Rust, & Python to keep my brain buzzing. My toolbox overflows with libraries like Express, NestJS, Sequelize, Mongoose, Jest, and more. 

But that's not all! Beyond the code, I'm comfortable navigating the infrastructure landscape. I leverage tools like Kafka for efficient data streaming, Sonarqube for maintaining code quality, and GitHub Actions for automated deployments. When it comes to the cloud, I'm proficient in AWS services like Lambda, EC2, S3, SQS, and SNS, using them to design and manage robust, scalable systems.

I'm on a mission to push the boundaries of what's possible! 🙌
